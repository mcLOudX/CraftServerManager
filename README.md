CraftServerManager
==================

Simple Bukkit server manager

========================================================
I. Introduction
========================================================

CraftServerManager is a simple Bukkit Server wrapper. 
Because it is simple, it doesn't offer very advanced 
functions like the other wrappers.

========================================================
II. Features
========================================================

- Install plugin(s) then reload automatically. The server
  will temporarily stops when overwriting plugin(s) (i.e updating) then
  starts again after the plugin(s) is/are installed. All done automatically.
- Run batch commands (one command after another)
- Save and run command routines with modifiable arguments.
- Auto-detection for Essentials. Some commands will adapt to the change.
- Now with broadcasting feature. Uses say command.

========================================================
III. Todo
========================================================

- Player list (haven't found a way yet)
- Auto update (bukkit.jar and CraftServerManager.exe)

========================================================
IV. Change Log
========================================================

v1.1
-----
- Added broadcast feature
- Fixed some bugs

v1.0
-----
- Initial Release

========================================================
V. Source Code
========================================================

Written in VB.NET. The source code is really messy, undocumented, and ugly. You wouldn't want to look at it. The controls are not named out of laziness (reaching Button49!), subs are written all over in random places without proper names, lines are not commented, etc. But I'll try uploading it later on to show you how bad it is.
